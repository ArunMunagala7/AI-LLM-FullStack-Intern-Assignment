      " According to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner-guiding moral principles, values, and beliefs that individuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the appropriate way to behave. They noted that ethical principles can be viewed at several levels, including individual ethics, occupational ethics, societal ethics, and organizational ethics. Individual ethics refers to personal standards and values that determine how people view their responsibilities to other people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self-interest is at stake. Occupational ethics refers to standards that govern how members of a particular profession, trade, or craft should conduct themselves when performing their work-related activities. Societal ethics refers to standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in matters that involve issues such as fairness, justice, poverty, and individual rights. Organizational ethics refers to the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view their duties and responsibilities to the organization's stakeholders.
