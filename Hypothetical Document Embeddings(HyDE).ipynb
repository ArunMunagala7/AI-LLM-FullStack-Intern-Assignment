In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.  The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n36  \\n• Individual ethics are  personal st andards and values that determine how people view their \\nresponsibilities to other people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self -\\ninterest is at stake  \\n• Occupational ethics are standards that govern how members of a p articular pr ofession, trade or craft \\nshould conduct themselves when performing their work -related activities  \\n• Organizational ethics are the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view \\ntheir duties and responsibilities to the organ ization’s st akeholders (e.g., owners, managers, employees, \\nsuppliers and distributors, customers and the surrounding community)  \\n• Societal ethics are standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in \\nmatters that involve issues such  as fairness , justice, poverty and individual rights\\n\\nKelly and Williams also offered ethical rules and principles that managers could use to analyze the impact \\nof their decisions on org anizational stakeholders:  \\n \\n• The “utilitarian” rule:  An ethical decision is one that produces the greatest good for the greatest \\nnumber of people, which means that managers should compare alternative courses of action based on \\nthe benefits and costs of each  alternative  for different organizational stakeholders  \\n• The “moral rights” rule: An ethical decision is the one that best maintains and protects the fundamental \\nrights and privileges of the people affected by it, which means managers must take into account the \\neffectiv e of each alternative decision on the rights of each affected stakeholder group.  \\n• The “justice” rule: An ethical decision is one that distributes both the benefits and the harms among the \\norganizational stakeholders in a fair, equitable or impar tial manner\\n\\n• The “practical” rule: An ethical decision is one that a manager would have no hesitation \\ncommunicating to others both inside and outside of the organization because they would find it to be\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and\\n\\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e.,\\n\\nVan Auken argued that ethical managers demonstrated certain characteristics including:  \\n \\n• Looking out for the interests of others, including customers, employees and minority members of \\nsociety  \\n• Valuing e mployees as people as well as workers and giving respect to their family responsibilities, \\ncommunity involvement and religious beliefs  \\n• Not deceiving people and simply telling them what they want to hear rather than the truth  \\n• Not playing psychological games  with others , such as blame -shifting, practicing one -upmanship or \\nplaying favorites  \\n• Valuing people over pragmatism and recognizing that how things are achieved is just as important as \\nwhat is achieved.  \\n• Focusing on the ultimate objective or mission (the “en ds”) more th an rules and regulations (the \\n“means”)  \\n• A commitment to ideals beyond self, such as honesty, fair play, and quality work  \\n \\nVan Auken went on to recommend that managers understand and adhere to several guiding ethical\\n\\nprinciples when engaging in s upervisory b ehavior:  \\n \\n• The “mission” principle: Stick to the basic mission of the organization (e.g., service, quality, value to \\nthe customer) as the day -to-day guide to supervisory behavior and decision making  \\n• The “consistency” principle:  Demand the same fair and obj ective standards from every employee.  \\n• The “constituency” principle: Consider the needs and rights of as many organizational stakeholders as \\npossible in decision making  \\n• The “proactive” principle: Seek to exceed minimum expectations or rules when  taking acti on and \\nstrive to find ways to deliver as much as possible to others  \\n• The “holism” principle: Remember to keep the “big picture” in mind at all times and recognize the \\nimportance of the personal side of employees in addition to their professional  activities,  the service \\nside of business along with the profit side and the needs of the minority as well as the majority\\n\\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

In order for t he manager t o act effectively and appropriately in those \\ninstances, he or she needs to have a fundamental understanding of ethics and how ethical principles apply \\nto managers and their organizations.  \\n \\nAccording to Kelly and Williams, ethics are the inner -guiding moral  principles, values, and beliefs that \\nindividuals and groups use to analyze or interpret a situation and then decide what is right and the \\nappropriate way to behave.  The concept of ethics can be viewed at several levels:  \\n \\n77 Id. at 15 -16.\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n36  \\n• Individual ethics are  personal st andards and values that determine how people view their \\nresponsibilities to other people and groups and how they should act in situations where their own self -\\ninterest is at stake  \\n• Occupational ethics are standards that govern how members of a p articular pr ofession, trade or craft \\nshould conduct themselves when performing their work -related activities  \\n• Organizational ethics are the guiding principles through which an organization and its managers view \\ntheir duties and responsibilities to the organ ization’s st akeholders (e.g., owners, managers, employees, \\nsuppliers and distributors, customers and the surrounding community)  \\n• Societal ethics are standards that govern how the members of a society deal with one another in \\nmatters that involve issues such  as fairness , justice, poverty and individual rights\\n\\nKelly and Williams also offered ethical rules and principles that managers could use to analyze the impact \\nof their decisions on org anizational stakeholders:  \\n \\n• The “utilitarian” rule:  An ethical decision is one that produces the greatest good for the greatest \\nnumber of people, which means that managers should compare alternative courses of action based on \\nthe benefits and costs of each  alternative  for different organizational stakeholders  \\n• The “moral rights” rule: An ethical decision is the one that best maintains and protects the fundamental \\nrights and privileges of the people affected by it, which means managers must take into account the \\neffectiv e of each alternative decision on the rights of each affected stakeholder group.  \\n• The “justice” rule: An ethical decision is one that distributes both the benefits and the harms among the \\norganizational stakeholders in a fair, equitable or impar tial manner\\n\\n• The “practical” rule: An ethical decision is one that a manager would have no hesitation \\ncommunicating to others both inside and outside of the organization because they would find it to be\\n\\nIntroduction to Management  Studies  \\n37 reasonable and acceptable (i.e., consistent with value s, norms and  standards typically acknowledged \\nand applied within the organization)  \\n \\nLegal and ethical principles are not necessarily the same; however, laws generally reflect the ethical norms \\nat a particular time.  Ethical principles are also subject to c hange over t ime as societies evolve.  Kelly and \\nWilliams noted that there are no absolute or indisputable ethical rules or principals, but it has been \\nsuggested the following core values arguably transcend political, religious, class and ethnic differences : \\ntrustworth iness (i.e., honesty and following through on promises made); respect (i.e., showing \\nconsideration for others and treating them as you would like to be treated); responsibility (i.e., \\nperseverance, self -discipline and personal accountability); fairness (i. e., providing equal opportunities and\\n\\nbeing open -minded); caring (i.e., kindness and compassion); and citizenship (i.e., cooperation and \\nwillingness to contribute to the broader community).  \\n \\nEffective managers understand the beliefs and behavio rs of ethica l individuals and attempt to practice them \\nas they engaged in their managerial roles and activities.  Trevino et al. suggested that this means managing \\nwith integrity and honesty, inspiring trust from subordinates, treating people the right way  and playing  \\nfairly and striving for a high level of moral development.  In addition, managers must do what they can to \\ncreate and maintain an ethical organization that is based on ethical leadership (i.e., leader communications \\nregarding ethics and values , role model ing, rewards for ethical behavior and swift and sure discipline for \\nunethical behavior) and structures and systems that support and reinforce ethical behavior (i.e.,\\n\\nVan Auken argued that ethical managers demonstrated certain characteristics including:  \\n \\n• Looking out for the interests of others, including customers, employees and minority members of \\nsociety  \\n• Valuing e mployees as people as well as workers and giving respect to their family responsibilities, \\ncommunity involvement and religious beliefs  \\n• Not deceiving people and simply telling them what they want to hear rather than the truth  \\n• Not playing psychological games  with others , such as blame -shifting, practicing one -upmanship or \\nplaying favorites  \\n• Valuing people over pragmatism and recognizing that how things are achieved is just as important as \\nwhat is achieved.  \\n• Focusing on the ultimate objective or mission (the “en ds”) more th an rules and regulations (the \\n“means”)  \\n• A commitment to ideals beyond self, such as honesty, fair play, and quality work  \\n \\nVan Auken went on to recommend that managers understand and adhere to several guiding ethical\\n\\nprinciples when engaging in s upervisory b ehavior:  \\n \\n• The “mission” principle: Stick to the basic mission of the organization (e.g., service, quality, value to \\nthe customer) as the day -to-day guide to supervisory behavior and decision making  \\n• The “consistency” principle:  Demand the same fair and obj ective standards from every employee.  \\n• The “constituency” principle: Consider the needs and rights of as many organizational stakeholders as \\npossible in decision making  \\n• The “proactive” principle: Seek to exceed minimum expectations or rules when  taking acti on and \\nstrive to find ways to deliver as much as possible to others  \\n• The “holism” principle: Remember to keep the “big picture” in mind at all times and recognize the \\nimportance of the personal side of employees in addition to their professional  activities,  the service \\nside of business along with the profit side and the needs of the minority as well as the majority\\n\\norganizational culture, code of ethics, ethics committee and chief ethics offi ce, ethics t raining and \\nprocedures for anonymous reporting of ethical concerns (“whistleblowing”)).  \\n \\nSources:  M.

A handful of other states have adopted \\nsimilar legislation covering benefit corporations, sometimes referred to as “B \\ncorpor ations”, and there viability will depend in large part on the development of case \\nlaw regarding the permissi ble purposes of such corporations and the flexibility afforded \\nto directors in discharging their fiduciary duties.  \\n \\nThe Ethical Manager  \\n \\nWhen carrying out their duties and responsibilities managers may often find themselves confronted with an \\n“ethical dil emma”, which a situation in the manager must decide whether to take a certain course of action \\nthat helps another person or group and which is the “right thing to do” even if the action is not in the\\n\\nInternet; increasing globalization; increasing diversity in the w orkplace and  the \\nmarketplace; growing recognition of the importance of intellectual capital including, but \\nnot limited to, intellectual property; and more focused attention on ethical behavior by \\nfirms and their managers.71  Each of these factors has had, a nd will cont inue to have, a \\nsignificant influence on core managerial activities, notably each of the elements of \\norganizational design.  In addition, of course, management must remain focused on \\ncreating value for customers in an efficient manner and on de veloping and  implementing \\nstrategies to attract necessary inputs such as capital, technology and human resources.  \\n \\n71 P.
